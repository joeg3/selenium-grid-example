   // When I was writing this, the latest version of Selenium was 2.53.1, and Firefox on
   // my Ubuntu machine was 49.0.  I kept getting this error:
   // org.openqa.selenium.firefox.NotConnectedException: Unable to connect to host 127.0.0.1 on port 7055 after 45000 ms
   // So from searching the web, I found that this has been happening for years where
   // as Selenium and FF change versions, they don't always play well together, and the
   // solution usually is to play with version numbers. So I got this error resolved by
   // downgrading Selenium to 2.47.0.
